By definition, Design Patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occuring problems.
Design patterns are very popular in Java and C# can be applied in all object oriented languages.
In functional languages like Scala,certain patterns are not necessary anymore.

There are four primary symptoms that tell us that our designs are rotting.
They are rigidity,fragility,immobility,and viscosity.//修改困难,脆弱,不可抑制,粘性

Principles of Object Oriented Class Design
1. The Open Closed Principle(OCP)
2. The Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP):Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
3. The Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP)
4. The Interface Segregation Principle(ISP)
5. The Demeter Principle
6. The Composite Reuse principle
